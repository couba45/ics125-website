            The project is based around the popular video game, Minecraft. The
            task is to create a mod and implement our ideas into the video game.
            We created a website to promote the mod and use MySQL to store the
            user information and feedback. The project was created because weâ€™re
            all interested in Minecraft. We strive to improve the vanilla
            version of the game to allow many gamers to have an increased
            immersive experience in Minecraft.
